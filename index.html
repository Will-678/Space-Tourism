                    <p>Ever since our first commercial space flight we have had the honor to have accopanied thousands aboard the Invictus to explore space and the moon itself. There have been no incidents, and we maintain an impeccable rating of five stars.</p>
                    <p class="normal">"The trip was great! The crew was so nice, and the food was delectable. Everything went smoothly, the launch was very tranquil, and before I knew it we were in space. We got to see the earth in orbit, walk on the moon, and do much more. I would strongly recommend this trip!"</p>

                    <h2 class="unwanted">The Invictus spacecraft</h2>
                    <p class="bl"> The spacecraft was constructed in a manner that promotes sights seeing. The ajustable seats make stargazing effortless. The windows consist of 4 layers, made materials that are extremely heat and cold resilient. The whole chassis of the Invictus was made with strong but maleable material so that even if anything undesireable happened the spacecraft it would not easily rip. There are also backup systems to ensure the safety of our passengers, such as our escape pods at the summit of the Invictus that would ejects from the mains body, and bring the passengers safely and slowly back down to earth. Our rockets always launch in the ocean aboard one of our ships so the noise does not bother anyone. This also means that our ships can launch from virtually anywhere in the world!</p>

                <div class="col col-1 col-bg">
                    <p>Our spaceships burn propellants and push out an exhaust that create an upward force which thrusts them into space. We are also on the point of finishing our tests regarding a more sustainable type of jet fuel. Space flight is the best way to explore something new that is litterally out of this world!</p>
